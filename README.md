This is the official code repository for 'Gallico'. This Ethereum, IPFs based platform was developed during the first edition of Hack NITR, an online hackathon conducted by NIT Rourkela.

# Overview

The Indian tourism industry has a market size of about $26.78B as of 2019. However, the theft, scam and overcharging of money from the tourists is not only deteriorating the Indian values but also reducing people's will to visit India thereby hurting the market value.

Therefore, We at Gallico came up with a platform that offers personalized experience to the places they want to visit or try out different servies we offer which would make their escapade awesome and memorable. We focussed on 4 main things:-

* Individuals can plan and book their trips whether it is for spending leisure time between your trains or want to explore new places or a month long vacation. After booking the user can also book rides like Shikara in kashmir where user will be assisgned a verified guide.

* The guides registered on the platform will be verified using blockchain.
We deployed a smart contract on rinkeby ethereum network which stores the ipfs hash of the document hosted on a decentralized Interplanetary FileSystem. We do this because hosting a document in general on a blockchain is an expensive affair. We can address large amount of data with ipfs and place the immutable, permanent ipfs links into a blockchain transaction. This timestamps and secures the documents on an immutable ledger and can be sent to the intended person in the form of an ipfs hash. 
* A chatbot that helps travellers on flight bookings based on information captured on travel dates, choice of airline and seating class. The chatbot also allows to choose a flight for travel and forwards the request to the travel agency for completing the booking. 

## Motivation
My friend and I got lured into this travel agency by being told it was "The official government travel agency". Numerous "random" people in the Connaught area told us to go there. They were very persuasive. Upon arrival, we were offered drinks and "great prices" for our trips. We booked our entire holiday through them in a total of 160,000 Rupees. The travel agent assured us that he was a government official, and showed pictures of beautiful hotels and attractions that he would book for us. Later that same day we went online and read reviews telling that the agency was a scam. We contacted all off the hotels, trains, and airlines and asked if they had reservations on our name, or by the travel agency. Neither of them had any bookings. The only booking that was valid was the train taking us to the middle of nowhere!
